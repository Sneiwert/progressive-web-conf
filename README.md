# Progressive Web Conf

This is a public repo with the ideas about the event called **Progressive Web Conf** (_working title_) dedicated to PWA and the future of the Web Platform which will happen in the end of October 2018 (_approximate date_) in London, UK (_approximate location_). At the moment this is a collection of my *very opinionated* thoughts. They **need** to be validated, discussed and corrected by all the involved parties.

Please, start the reading from the [Motivation](https://github.com/webmaxru/progressive-web-conf/issues/3) section, then have a look at [Speakers & content](https://github.com/webmaxru/progressive-web-conf/issues/2), then [Type, location, date](https://github.com/webmaxru/progressive-web-conf/issues/1), and [Sponsors and pricing](https://github.com/webmaxru/progressive-web-conf/issues/4).

Please, review, comment ang join the movement if you wish! If you just want to keep yourself updated about the event, [follow my Twitter](https://twitter.com/webmaxru) and/or join the open [PWA slack team](https://bit.ly/go-pwa-slack)
